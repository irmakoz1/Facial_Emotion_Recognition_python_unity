This repository is for using Facial Emotion Recognition with Deepface and OpenCV in Unity with a UDP server between Unity and Python.

Thanks to these 2 repositories I was able to develop this repository: 

1- Python Unity Socket Communication Created by Youssef Elashry.


2- Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-Deepface by Manish Tipari.

With this, you do not have to pay the OpenCV extension in Unity. Just by changing the code a bit, you can send and receive any data between Python and Unity.

Steps:

1. Launch the server in Python: (If you want, change the timing of sending the data.)
2. It already contains a sample scene in Unity. If you press play, you should be able to see your webcam stream and emotion. Emotion data is coded as emotion in the UdpSocket script.
